    <h2> What Are Tokimon?</h2>
    <p> A Tokimon is a rare creature found in the remote areas of Korea. For the most part, they
      resemble rabbits and the only form of communication they have with us is the ability to say
      their own name. Tokimons come in all shapes and sizes, have special abilities, and tend to fight
      with each other on occasion. Each Tokimon could have the ability to fly, fight, throw fire, spray
      water, electrify, and freeze other Tokimons. Because they are such primitive creatures but have such extraordinary abilities, they
      need Tokimon trainers. The trainerâ€™s is job to collect Tokimons and use them accordingly </p>
